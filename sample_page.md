## Search Engine Retrieval System 

**Project description:** I created a search engine retrieval system from scratch that crawls the web pages in the domain https://www.bosch.us and returns the top 7 most relevant web pages based on the userâ€™s search query. The search retrieval system consists of two python files, one that contains the index of the website (called final_index.py) and the other file that retrieves the users search query and returns the relevant web pages (called queryRetrieve.py). 

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

My implementation included the basic components including separate crawler, indexer, and query processing components

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

The indexing component parsed and indexed the web pages using inverted file format along with relevant term frequency information

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
