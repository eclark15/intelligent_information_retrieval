## Search Engine Retrieval System 

**Project description:** 

In this IR project, I created a search engine retrieval system from scratch that crawls the web pages in the domain https://www.bosch.us and returns the top 7 most relevant web pages based on the user’s search query. My implementation includes the primary elements of a document retrieval system such as a web crawler, indexer, and query processing components. 

The search retrieval system consists of two python files, one that contains the index of the website ([final_index.py](https://github.com/eclark15/intelligent_information_retrieval/blob/c6f9a69339e48d05afc0749053f34ca27af04d95/python_files/final_index.py)) and the second file which retrieves the user’s search query and returns the relevant web pages ([queryRetrieve.py](https://github.com/eclark15/intelligent_information_retrieval/blob/c6f9a69339e48d05afc0749053f34ca27af04d95/python_files/queryRetrieve.py)).

### 1. Creating a website index 

First, in final_index.py I gathered a list of the website’s URLs. The system crawls all of the website pages recursively using a crawl() function and gathers the web page links using the Beautiful Soup class while simultaneously cleaning the URLs and removing unwanted pages such as PDFs. 

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

The indexing component parsed and indexed the web pages using inverted file format along with relevant term frequency information

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
